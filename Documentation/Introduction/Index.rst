   The default editor configuration (of element "Table (Excel Spreadsheets)") allows the user to select a worksheet to display in frontend.

.. hint::
   :class: cc

   Please note the header row of the default element "Table (Excel Spreadsheets)" above which outputs the existing styling of the spreadsheet cells!

   Per default the element will use and output cell styling (except conditional styles) which might be set in programs like Excel.

   If you want to output only table data and use your own table styling heads up to the "Appearance" tab and tick the checkbox on "Spreadsheet Styling" to disable default styling.
